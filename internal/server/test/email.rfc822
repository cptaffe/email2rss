A Scalable Real-Time SDN-Based MQTT Framework for Industrial
Applications
-----------------------------------------------------------------

JournalClub.io, October 21st, 2024

Hi Connor, today's article comes from the IEEE Open Journal of
the Industrial Electronics Society. The authors are Shahri et
al., from the University of Aveiro, in Portugal. In this paper
they argue that the MQTT protocol is not suitable for industrial
applications because it lacks timeliness guarantees. They propose
a new system to overcome these limitations. Let's see what they
came up with.

Let=E2=80=99s say you and I are Oompa Loompas in a chocolate factory. We
have various jobs, and we do all the meaningful work, while the
crazy guy in the hat gets all the credit. But that=E2=80=99s fine, it=E2=80=
=99s
what we signed up for. Your job is to take caramel squares and
dip them in chocolate. Then you hand them to me. I sprinkle a
little salt on top and carefully wrap each chocolate-covered
caramel in a cellophane wrapper, twist the ends, and then place
that carefully in a box lined with tissue paper. You dip, I wrap.

Everything=E2=80=99s fine except you can dip way faster than I can wrap.
It takes you 2 seconds to dunk a caramel, and it takes me 10
seconds to sprinkle, wrap, and put it in the box. So what do we
do? If you dunk as fast as you can, you=E2=80=99re going to be sending me
chocolates 5X faster than I can wrap them, and within a few
minutes we=E2=80=99re going to have an =E2=80=9CI Love Lucy=E2=80=9D situat=
ion where I=E2=80=99m
stuffing chocolates in my pockets to keep up with your pace.
Nobody wants that.

So we have at least two options. We can, for example:

* Hire 4 more Oompa Loompas to work with me, doing the same job.
So now we can collectively wrap them just as fast as you can dunk
them. But for maximum efficiency when you wrap a chocolate, it
needs to go to whichever Oompa Loompa has their hands free. So we
need a mechanism, some kind of fancy conveyor belt that can do
that.
* Leave it as just me at the wrapping station, but instead of the
chocolates coming right to me, they should get placed on a
cooling rack. So now I don=E2=80=99t need to worry about how fast you=E2=80=
=99re
placing them on the cooling rack; I=E2=80=99ll just take one rack at a
time, pull one chocolate off, and take my time wrapping it, then
move on to the next one. This makes sense in a lot of cases
because let=E2=80=99s say you only dunk caramels for the one hour a day
after the caramel cooking process finishes. So during that hour
you=E2=80=99re dunking like a madman, but in reality, I don=E2=80=99t need =
to
keep up with you during that moment. In the course of my 8-hour
shift, I=E2=80=99ll be able to more than cover the caramels you dunked
during your hour.

In these two examples: the fancy conveyor belt, and the cooling
racks. These are both examples of queues. And you and I, the
Oompa Loompas, are components or =E2=80=9Cworkers=E2=80=9D in a distributed
system (a factory in this case). The queues in our factory, these
special pieces of equipment that allow us to buffer the work that
needs to be done between different components, are the core of
all distributed systems. Whether those distributed systems are
web applications, car assembly lines, or a long-running mapreduce
functions, odds are: there is some kind of queuing mechanism at
their core. Queues are the fundamental data structure, the
skeleton that makes giant unwieldy, unpredictable systems
possible. In my opinion, this was best articulated in 2014 in the
Reactive Manifesto. If you=E2=80=99ve never read it, check out
reactivemanifesto.org (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/92u9qde2d0fnhq8p7o3c9hz3vmd33aw/e0hph7h0=
3x8m76i8/aHR0cHM6Ly9yZWFjdGl2ZW1hbmlmZXN0by5vcmc=3D
) it only takes a couple of minutes to read the whole thing.

There are a number of commercial queuing products on the market.
AWS SQS is probably the biggest name there; Google Cloud also
offers a pub/sub that=E2=80=99s very popular. But those kinds of cloud
service offerings aren=E2=80=99t always the right form factor for the
system you=E2=80=99re building.
=E2=80=8B
=E2=80=8BBy the way, don=E2=80=99t get hung up on the difference between a
=E2=80=9Cpub/sub=E2=80=9D and a =E2=80=9Cqueue=E2=80=9D. There are certainl=
y differences but for
the purpose of this episode we=E2=80=99re treating them as one family of
products and using the terms interchangeably.

Anyway, sometimes it makes sense to use the cloud queues,
sometimes it makes sense to operate your own queue. Many of the
open-source options aren=E2=80=99t just applications, but they=E2=80=99re
actually a set of novel queuing protocols and the application
that uses them. So if you use RabbitMQ, that=E2=80=99s all going to be
based on the AMQP protocol. If you=E2=80=99re going to use ZeroMQ, it=E2=80=
=99s
based on ZMTP.

Side note about ZeroMQ. If you want to go down a rabbit hole on
queuing, there is a YouTube video from a decade ago called
=E2=80=9CPieter Hintjens - Distribution, Scale and Flexibility with
ZeroMQ (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/92u9qde2d0fnhq8p7o3c9hz3vmd33aw/7qh7h8ho=
2grd9lhz/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS95aEdYSjlKdDMtQQ=3D=3D
)=E2=80=9D that only has, I think, 12k total views. It is in my top 5
best tech talks I=E2=80=99ve ever seen. If you=E2=80=99re in management or
leadership in any way and you=E2=80=99ve never heard of Conway's Law,
stop listening to this episode right now and go watch that
instead. RIP to Pieter.

I digress. In addition to the AMQP protocol and the ZMTP
protocol, there=E2=80=99s a protocol called MQTT: the Message Queuing
Telemetry Transport protocol. Like some of the others, it=E2=80=99s an
application-layer protocol but it's built on top of TCP. So if
you think of the OSI model, it lives in the same layer as things
like HTTP, FTP, and SSH. MQTT has been around since the late 90s;
it=E2=80=99s big and open, it has an ISO standard, and a governing body
and all that. It=E2=80=99s not like a small 1-person-in-a-garage kind of
thing, it=E2=80=99s a big legitimate protocol, and changes to that
protocol take time, and there=E2=80=99s a process and a bureaucracy to
navigate. MQTT doesn=E2=80=99t change on a whim.

So that brings us to today=E2=80=99s paper, which, by my account, is at
least the 6th paper by these authors about this topic. They have
been, since, I believe 2021, slowly building the case in a series
of articles that MQTT isn=E2=80=99t currently suitable for industrial
applications, and they have a proposal for how exactly we can
overcome that.

In previous work, they defined the problem space, mapped out
possible options, and architected a solution, and this paper is
actually just enhancing the previous solution and then running a
bunch of advanced benchmarking and analysis on it to prove that
it does what they claim it can do. Based on some of the hints
they dropped during the paper, I=E2=80=99m going to guess that they have
at least 5-6 more papers to publish on this, that will probably
take them several more years, so this one comes right in the
middle of this giant decade-long case that they=E2=80=99re making. Since
we=E2=80=99ve never talked about their research at all, I figured now
would be a good time to catch up on the problem they defined, the
solution they=E2=80=99ve architected so far, and then give a preview of
where this research is going over the next couple of years.

The problem with MQTT:

Think of MQTT as offering 3 types of message delivery:

* Unicast: One sender, one recipient
* Multicast: One sender, a sub-group of recipients
* Broadcast: One sender, all recipients. Technically, MQTT
doesn=E2=80=99t do broadcasts natively, but in practice, that can be
implemented by the user.

Within those services, they offer different QoS (quality of
service) guarantees, named QoS 0, 1, and 2:

* QoS 0: Send once. This is like me dropping a postcard in a
mailbox. I can guarantee that I sent it. Whether or not anyone
ever receives it is really their problem. In some cases, this is
all you need. Maybe the thing going into the queue is an alert
notification. And the user only needs to see it if they=E2=80=99re
currently in the app and have strong WiFi, and if they miss the
alert, it doesn=E2=80=99t really matter.
* QoS 1: Deliver at least once. This is like me sending a letter
that requires a signature. If they try to deliver it and nobody=E2=80=99s
home, I might just send another copy, and another, and another,
and now I have multiple mail carriers all coming to your door
with this letter. And when you finally do answer the door, they
might hand you a stack of a hundred of them. That=E2=80=99s fine, as long
as I know you got at least one of them, and signed it, that=E2=80=99s all
I care about. Sometimes a system will need to perform idempotent
operations where it really doesn=E2=80=99t matter if it=E2=80=99s invoked t=
wice,
as long as it=E2=80=99s invoked at least once=E2=80=94that's all we care ab=
out.
* QoS 2: Deliver exactly once. This is like I=E2=80=99m sending you a
package of something expensive you ordered from my store. You
have to get it, and you have to confirm that you got it, but you
only ordered one, so under no circumstances should you get the
package twice. Any action in a distributed system that is
mission-critical and not idempotent would probably fall under
this use case. That being said, deliver-exactly-once has
significant overhead. There=E2=80=99s a 4-way handshake involved, and
just a lot of pieces that need to be synced up. But let=E2=80=99s say
your system is sending money from one person to another. If that
needs to happen once and only once, and the ramifications of it
happening zero times or more than 1 time are disastrous, then the
overhead of QoS 2 is worth it.

The issue with these guarantees (QoS 0,1,2) is not about what
they offer, it=E2=80=99s about what they don=E2=80=99t. None of these guara=
ntees
offer anything concerning timeliness. The guarantees say what is
going to happen, but not when it=E2=80=99s going to happen. There=E2=80=99s=
 no
way for me to say, for example: =E2=80=9CI need at-least-once delivery
within this specified time frame=E2=80=9D. Why does this matter? Well,
let=E2=80=99s go back to the chocolate factory. Let=E2=80=99s say the caram=
els
you=E2=80=99re dipping right now are a special order for Violet=E2=80=99s
birthday, tomorrow. They=E2=80=99re special caramels, they=E2=80=99ve got h=
er
name stamped right into the chocolate coating. That order needs
to be boxed and packaged to go out by this afternoon. You=E2=80=99re
loading up these cooling racks with chocolates, there=E2=80=99s no way
for you to communicate to me that not only should I prioritize
these, but there is a specific deadline I need to hit.

These lack of temporal / timeliness / =E2=80=9Cpredictable execution=E2=80=
=9D
guarantees, the authors argue, make MQTT unsuitable for
industrial environments. And that should make some kind of
intuitive sense. If you=E2=80=99re running a factory, you need to be able
to delegate things to different priority levels and attach
specific timelines to their delivery and execution. Without that,
your job is a lot harder.

What the authors propose:

Starting in MQTT version 5, which was released in 2019,
developers can add what=E2=80=99s called =E2=80=9Cuser properties=E2=80=9D =
to a message.
Instead of the message having a fixed header and a payload,
there=E2=80=99s a fixed header, a payload, and what=E2=80=99s called a
variable-payload where you can add key-value pairs of data. So in
their proposal, they=E2=80=99re adding a series of key-value pairs to the
variable payload:

* Flow Index (i): This identifies the specific data flow. It
helps in distinguishing multiple flows of messages in the system.
* Transmission Time (Ci): Specifies the time it takes to transmit
a message, including any overhead.
* Priority (Pi): Indicates the priority level of the message.
* Period (Ti): Defines the minimum inter-arrival time or period
between two successive messages published by the sender.
* Deadline (Di): Specifies the maximum allowable time for the
message to be delivered. It must be less than or equal to the
period.
* Bandwidth Usage (BWi): Defines the maximum bandwidth that the
message can use.

But all of those new key-value pairs in the user properties don=E2=80=99t
magically do anything by themselves, right? It=E2=80=99s like, if I drop
a postcard in the mail and write on it =E2=80=9CHey USPS, deliver this by
Thursday=E2=80=9D, that=E2=80=99s not going to have any effect on anything =
at
all. Conveying my timeliness desire doesn=E2=80=99t matter if there=E2=80=
=99s not
also the infrastructure in place to make good on my request. With
USPS, that means buying the class of post that guarantees
delivery at a certain date. With MQTT, we need some kind of
system that can look at the requests in the header and make good
on them. That is where SDN comes in.

Very briefly, SDN (software-defined networking) is basically an
application built into switches, routers, and other internet
infrastructure that can route packets based on logic instead of
just analog routing. We covered SDN in more detail in the episode
on October 9th titled =E2=80=9CTraffic Classification in Software-Defined
Networking Using Genetic Programming Tools.=E2=80=9D I=E2=80=99d recommend
reviewing that episode for more details. And another sidenote:
This is a good time to mention, as of yesterday afternoon, the
episode archive is up at JournalClub.io/archive (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/92u9qde2d0fnhq8p7o3c9hz3vmd33aw/owhkhqhr=
mz2xwdav/aHR0cHM6Ly9qb3VybmFsY2x1Yi5pby9hcmNoaXZl
). So if there are any episodes from the past that you missed and
you want access to, like the SDN episode I just mentioned, go to
the archive, find the episode name, and then send me a note with
the episode name so I can re-trigger the email send for you. At
some point, re-sends will be fully automated, but, baby steps.

Anyway, back to the story. When MQTT is running, and its
publishers are sending unicasts, multicasts, and broadcasts
through the MQTT broker and out to the subscribers, the packets
involved may be getting routed through SDN (if you=E2=80=99ve set up that
kind of system). So in the authors=E2=80=99 proposal, the SDN looks at
the headers, sees the timeliness requests, and then performs the
routing in a way that maximizes the chances of those timeliness
requests being honored.

And that=E2=80=99s basically it, in a nutshell. The system they defined
is called RT-MQTT (Real-Time MQTT) and MRT-MQTT (Multicast
Real-Time MQTT), which for all intents and purposes is a superset
of RT-MQTT with extra logic for those use cases.

Most of the paper is spent defining the architecture, governing
logic and algorithms for how the SDNs would operate, but then the
authors spend a considerable amount of time simulating and
analyzing the performance of their new system. They set up
emulations in Mininet, which is a network emulator, and used the
Ryu OpenFlow controller to simulate some of the lower-level
aspects of SDN. They ran the system under low, medium, and high
loads and focused their analysis on WCRT.

WCRT stands for Worst-Case Response Time. If you=E2=80=99re familiar with
Big O notation for algorithms, it=E2=80=99s a lot like that, but for a
distributed system, in the way that they both represent upper
bounds. In order to produce WCRT, they first calculated HA and
TA. HA (Holistic Approach) focuses on the cumulative delays
across all nodes and switches on the path, while TA (Trajectory
Approach) calculates the latest time a message could start at its
final destination by working backward through the network path.
HA is more pessimistic, but TA requires more computational
resources and complexity to implement. So they considered both.
Here are the broad strokes of their results:

* MRT-MQTT outperforms MQTT: The system reduced Worst-Case
Response Time (WCRT) significantly for time-sensitive traffic in
multi-edge networks.
* Traffic prioritization enhances timing guarantees: Prioritized
messages exhibited lower WCRT compared to lower-priority
messages, showing that the framework effectively manages
different priority levels.
* Schedulability analysis validated: Both Holistic Approach (HA)
and Trajectory Approach (TA) provided accurate WCRT estimates
that closely matched the experimentally observed results,
demonstrating the reliability of the analysis methods.
* Trade-off between accuracy and complexity: HA provided faster
but more pessimistic results, while TA gave tighter, more precise
WCRT bounds but at the cost of increased computational
complexity.

The road ahead:=E2=80=8B
=E2=80=8B
The results so far are promising, but the authors aren't done
yet. Over the next few years, we can expect more papers from them
that will go further and deeper on this. Future research is
likely to focus on improving scalability across even larger
multi-edge networks, refining the precision of the real-time
schedulability analyses, and exploring advanced techniques for
handling mixed traffic loads with minimal impact on non-real-time
data. They may also investigate integrating more robust security
mechanisms that don't compromise the timeliness guarantees.

We=E2=80=99ll be keeping an eye on them as they continue to publish. And
when there=E2=80=99s a big announcement, you=E2=80=99ll hear about it here =

 assembly lines, or a long-running mapreduce functions, odds are: there is =
some kind of queuing mechanism at their core. Queues are the fundamental da=
ta structure, the skeleton that makes giant unwieldy, unpredictable systems=

QP protocol and the ZMTP protocol, there=E2=80=99s a protocol called MQTT: =
the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol. Like some of the others, =
it=E2=80=99s an application-layer protocol but it's built on top of TCP. So=
 if you think of the OSI model, it lives in the same layer as things like H=
TTP, FTP, and SSH. MQTT has been around since the late 90s; it=E2=80=99s bi=
g and open, it has an ISO standard, and a governing body and all that. It=
=E2=80=99s not like a small 1-person-in-a-garage kind of thing, it=E2=80=99=

ere=E2=80=99s a process and a bureaucracy to navigate. MQTT doesn=E2=80=99t=

nother, and now I have multiple mail carriers all coming to your door with =
this letter. And when you finally do answer the door, they might hand you a=
 stack of a hundred of them. That=E2=80=99s fine, as long as I know you got=

MQTT is running, and its publishers are sending unicasts, multicasts, and b=
roadcasts through the MQTT broker and out to the subscribers, the packets i=
nvolved may be getting routed through SDN (if you=E2=80=99ve set up that ki=
nd of system). So in the authors=E2=80=99 proposal, the SDN looks at the he=
aders, sees the timeliness requests, and then performs the routing in a way=
 that maximizes the chances of those timeliness requests being honored.</p>

height:1.5;text-transform:none" class=3D"">And that=E2=80=99s basically it,=
 in a nutshell. The system they defined is called RT-MQTT (Real-Time MQTT) =
and MRT-MQTT (Multicast Real-Time MQTT), which for all intents and purposes=
 is a superset of RT-MQTT with extra logic for those use cases.</p>
<p style=3D"margin:1em 0;font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, san=

height:1.5;text-transform:none" class=3D"">Most of the paper is spent defin=
ing the architecture, governing logic and algorithms for how the SDNs would=
 operate, but then the authors spend a considerable amount of time simulati=
ng and analyzing the performance of their new system. They set up emulation=
s in Mininet, which is a network emulator, and used the Ryu OpenFlow contro=
ller to simulate some of the lower-level aspects of SDN. They ran the syste=
m under low, medium, and high loads and focused their analysis on WCRT.</p>

nse Time. If you=E2=80=99re familiar with Big O notation for algorithms, it=
=E2=80=99s a lot like that, but for a distributed system, in the way that t=
hey both represent upper bounds. In order to produce WCRT, they first calcu=
lated HA and TA. HA (Holistic Approach) focuses on the cumulative delays ac=
ross all nodes and switches on the path, while TA (Trajectory Approach) cal=
culates the latest time a message could start at its final destination by w=
orking backward through the network path. HA is more pessimistic, but TA re=
quires more computational resources and complexity to implement. So they co=
nsidered both. Here are the broad strokes of their results:</p>

ne yet. Over the next few years, we can expect more papers from them that w=
ill go further and deeper on this. Future research is likely to focus on im=
proving scalability across even larger multi-edge networks, refining the pr=
ecision of the real-time schedulability analyses, and exploring advanced te=
chniques for handling mixed traffic loads with minimal impact on non-real-t=
ime data. They may also investigate integrating more robust security mechan=
isms that don't compromise the timeliness guarantees.</p>
